# KPMG-Data-Ananlytics-
The KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship.
The repository encompasses my tasks in the virtual Data Analytics Internship at KPMG AU. The main tasks accomplished during the period of internship are as follows:  

1.  Data Quality Assessment: reviewing the data for quality to ensure that it is ready for analysis, take down notes of any issues discovered, as well as recommendations going forward to mitigate current data quality concerns.

2.  Data Insights: PowerPoint presentation which outlines the approach which we will be taking involving this 3 data analytics phase - Data Exploration, Model Development and Interpretation.
The PowerPoint presentation includes a detailed approach for the strategy behind each of the 3 phases including activities involved in each - i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting. 

3.  Data Insights and Presentation: developed a dashboard to present our finding in the following business context:  
What are the trends in the underlying data?  
Which customer segment has the highest customer value?  
What do you propose should be Sprocket Central Pty Ltd â€™s marketing and growth strategy?  
What additional external datasets may be useful to obtain greater insights into customer preferences and propensity to purchase the products?  

Note:
The work is unique and kindly do not attempt to reciprocate it in any manner. Kindly notify me for any improvements and reuse of work.

Thank You.
